## My process
### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts ('Red Hat Display')

### What I learned
- After I finished the project I relaized that I could have structured the html better and use better css techniques to postion and align the content of the card but all I used was absolute positioning which broke the accessibility as well as functionality, there were different layers of `<div>` component all over the card and I had to use `Z-index` property to fix it. The accessibility is still broken but moving forward I will be more thoughtful of it and do better work.

### Continued development
- I was able to complete this challenge and made it how it is supposed to look like. However, I wanted to animate the svg of the component-card header and will be working on it soon.
